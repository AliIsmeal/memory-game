# Matching Memory Game

## About Memory Game Project

The starter project was provided by Udacity, It included some HTML and CSS styling  to display a static version of the Memory Game project. my task was converting this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files but primarily the JavaScript file, and adding responsive design to display the memory game on small, medium and large devices.


## How To Play

 Click on [Matching Game](https://aliismeal.github.io/memory-game.github.io/)
 -The Matching Memory Game contains 16 cards, the timer  starts when the user load the game, the user needs to match two cards each time, eight pairs need to be matched to win the game within two minutes, the stars rating accounts the number of moves, at the beginning three stars will appear on score panel, after 12 moves two stars and empty star will appear, and after 16 moves only on star and two empty stars  will appear.
 When the user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It  also tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
